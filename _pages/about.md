Welcome! I’m Dr. Guadalupe Cañas-Herrera (Cañas from my father and Herrera from my mother), a Spanish scientist currently based in the Netherlands. My research sits at the interface between theory and observations, with a strong focus on combining diverse astronomical probes and advanced data-analysis techniques to extract robust cosmological information.

I grew up in Cantabria, was born in Madrid, and my family roots lie in La Mancha. Alongside my scientific career, I hold a Conservatoire degree in Music and Piano, and I am also an active, certified freelance fitness instructor—two pursuits that continue to shape how I think about discipline, creativity, and balance.

Belonging to one of the first Spanish generations to fully benefit from EU education programmes, I pursued a strongly international academic path. I completed a French bilingual secondary diploma, participated in the Comenius and Erasmus programmes, studied Dutch through the Erasmus Intensive Language Courses, and travelled widely across Europe with an Interrail Pass. I have lived in Spain, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands, and I am fluent in Spanish, English, Dutch, and French, with working knowledge of German. These experiences shaped a strong European identity and a deep belief in international cooperation.

Colleagues often describe me as (perhaps overly) disciplined, (too) energetic, (strictly) organised, and (very!) approachable. I take particular satisfaction in building structure, encouraging collaboration, and bringing people together around shared goals. Outside of work, I enjoy caring for plants and experimenting with creative home-cooking recipes for friends and family.
