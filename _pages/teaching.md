Teaching is one of the most rewarding parts of my work. I value:

- **Close interaction** with students
- **Translating complex ideas** into accessible examples
- **Supporting learning** through questions, discussion, and well-designed lecture materials and exercises

**Training:** Introduction to Teaching for PhD Candidates, Leiden University
