    <p>In the last two years and a half, the several research activities I was involved in made me develop a genuine interest in Cosmology. Concretely, I enjoy working at the frontier between Theoretical Physics models and data analysis; precisely, how those theoretical models can be tested by means of exploting Cosmological data. If you would like to discover how I was driven towards Cosmology, I invite you to read this post. On the other hand, if you want to know what my current and past research activities are, read below.</p>
<h3>Inflation</h3>
<p>At the moment, I am part of the <a href="https://www.lorentz.leidenuniv.nl/cosmology/">Lorentz Institute Theoretical Cosmology Group</a>, carrying out my MSc. Research Project under the direction of <a href="https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/staffmembers/ana-achucarro#tab-1">Dr. Ana Achúcarro</a> and <a href="https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/staffmembers/matteo-martinelli#tab-1">Dr. Matteo Martinelli</a>, working together with <a href="http://astronomy.sussex.ac.uk/~jt386/">Dr. Jesús Torrado</a>.</p>
<p>By means of analysing CMB power spectrum and bispectrum data, I explore new posibilities of the canonical slow-roll inflation scenario. More especificlly, I propose new ansatzs to model features produced by transient reductions in the speed of sound of the inflaton in an effectively-single-field slow-roll scenario . Those reductions in the speed of sound are though to produce correlated features in both the primordial power spectrum P(k) and bispectrum P(k1,k2,k3).</p>

<h3>Astroparticle Physics</h3>
<p>I completed an internship at the Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron (DESY) placed in Zeuthen,
a Research Centre of the Helmholtz Association, enrolled as Summer Student in the
programme of 2016. I was part of the Astroparticle Physics Theory Group (THAT), which studies very energetic particles that make of Cosmic Rays (CR), neutrinos, and gamma-rays. They focus on the
theoretical description of physical systems in which particle acceleration is believed to
take place, for instance in Supernova Remnants (SNRs), Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN),
and Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRB). In particular, I worked under Shan Gao’s and Robert Brose’s advice. </p>
<p>My task was to model astroparticles acceleration in Supernova Remnants (SNRs) in order to obtain neutrino
flux spectra. I modified a python code that solves the transport equation of particles in SNRs in order to include the contribution for neutrinos. I checked the results from these simulations to the object SNR RX J1713.7-3946 with both analytic expressions and simplified approximations in order to test their veracity, as well as with previous carried out works for this precise SNR. According to our results, we
have concluded that the estimated neutrino spectra expected from RX J1713.7-3946 will be below the flux of atmospheric neutrinos, so that it will be unlikely to be detected.</p>

<h3>Weak Lensing</h3>
<p>I completed my BSc. Research project in both Brown University, at the Physics Department with <a href="https://vivo.brown.edu/display/idellant">Dr. Ian Dell'Antonio</a>, and University of Cantabria, at the <a href="https://ifca.unican.es/en-us/research/observational-cosmology-and-instrumentation">Observational Cosmology and Instrumentation group at Instituto de Física de Cantabria (IFCA)</a>, under the direction of <a href="http://max.ifca.unican.es/vielva/">Dr. Patricio Vielva</a>.</p>
<p>In this project, photographies from Subaru Telescope of Lockman Hole area have been studied, obtaining catalogues of galaxies and stars with the aim of estimating galaxy clusters from the shear associated to shapes of galaxies produced by dark matter through the weak lensing effect. To obtain these catalogues, it was necessary to carry out a correction between images in the optical and in the near infrared. The
catalogues have been filtered and corrected with the purpose of eliminating point spread function anisotropies related with the telescope due to difference sources such as the atmosphere. The results are dark matter distribution maps as a function of the galaxies magnitudes. A list of possible galaxy clusters has been found in this field, identifying these candidates with previous observations performed in x-ray and with other works also based on weak lensing effect.</p>
