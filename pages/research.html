    <p>In the last two years and a half, the several research activities I was involved in made me develop a genuine interest in Cosmology. Concretely, I enjoy working at the frontier between Theoretical Physics models regarding the Early Universe, and data analysis; precisely, how those theoretical models can be tested by means of exploting Cosmological data. If you would like to discover how I was driven towards Cosmology and what my current and past research activities are, read below.</p>
<h2>Inflation</h2>
<p>At the moment, I am part of the <a href="https://www.lorentz.leidenuniv.nl/cosmology/">Lorentz Institute Theoretical Cosmology Group</a>, carrying out my MSc. Research Project under the direction of Dr. Ana Achúcarro and Dr. Matteo Martinelli, working together with Dr. Jesús Torrado.</p>
<p>By means of analysing CMB power spectrum and bispectrum data, I study for simple extensions to the canonical slow-roll inflation scenario. This is of special interest due to the fact that Planck data favour canonical single-field inflationary theories </p>
<p>Although Planck data so far favour a canonical single-field scenario, hints of features of different kinds are present both in the power spectrum and bispectrum (arXiv:1502.02114, arXiv:1502.01592). From a model-independent approach, those hints are not statistically significant. However, if a physical model can produce those features simultaneously in both observables, and if that model is simple enough, those hints can turn into significant bayesian evidence for , provided that the model is simple enough.</p>
<p>In particular, I look for features produced by transient reductions in the speed of sound of the inflaton in an effectively-single-field slow-roll scenario (e.g. produced by soft, sudden turns along the inflationary trayectory). Those reductions in cs produce correlated features in both the primordial power spectrum (k) and bispectrum (k1,k2,k3). Those features are linear-in-k oscillations with a localised envelope (arXiv:1211.5619). The results of our search so far can be seen in arXiv:1311.2552, arXiv:1404.7522 and arXiv:1410.4804.</p>
<h2>Astroparticle Physics</h2>
<p>I completed an internship at the Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron (DESY) placed in Zeuthen,
a Research Centre of the Helmholtz Association, enrolled as Summer Student in the
programme of 2016. </p>
<p>Concretely, the Astroparticle Physics Theory Group (THAT) studies very energetic
particles that make of Cosmic Rays (CR), neutrinos, and gamma-rays. They keep on the
theoretical description of physical systems in which particle acceleration is believed to
take place, for instance in Supernova Remnants (SNRs), Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN),
and Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRB). Different methods are used to model the behaviour
of those particles such as hydrodynamical simulations, kinetic models following the
individual particles, and global radiation models. I joined this group at DESY, specifically
working under Shan Gao’s and Robert Brose’s advice.</p>
<h2>Weak Lensing</h2>
<p>Photographies from Subaru Telescope of Lockman Hole area have been studied, obtaining catalogues
of galaxies and stars with the aim of estimating galaxy clusters from the shear associated to shapes
of galaxies produced by dark matter through the weak lensing effect. To obtain these catalogues, it
was necessary to carry out a correction between images in the optical and in the near infrared. The
catalogues have been filtered and corrected with the purpose of eliminating point spread function
anisotropies related with the telescope due to difference sources such as the atmosphere. The results
are dark matter distribution maps as a function of the galaxies magnitudes. A list of possible galaxy
clusters has been found in this field, identifying these candidates with previous observations performed
in x-ray and with other works also based on weak lensing effect.</p>
