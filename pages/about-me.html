    <p>Hi eveyone! <em>¡Hola a todos!</em> This is <strong>Guadalupe Cañas Herrera</strong>, a cosmologist to be, currently enrrolled in the MSc. in Physics at <a href="https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en">Leiden University</a> (The Netherlands), pursuing the specialization in Cosmology with a focus on Theoretical Physics (<a href="http://leidendesitter.nl/de_Sitter/Welcome.html">De Sitter Programme</a>). Previously, I studied at <a href="http://web.unican.es/centros/ciencias">University of Cantabria </a>(Spain), my home institution, at <a href="https://www.uu.nl/en">Utrecht University</a> (The Netherlands), as an Erasmus student, and at <a href="https://www.brown.edu">Brown University</a> (USA), as an exchange student as well. From these universities, I obtained my BSc. in Physics with a track in Fundamental Physics, with high experimental content. If you are interested in discovering how I felt in love with Cosmology, and in what and with whom I have worked, I invite you to click in Research or to read my CV.</p>
<p>Getting into personal details, I was born in <a href="https://www.esmadrid.com/en">Madrid</a>, Spain, in spite of the fact that all my relatives are from <a href="http://www.turismocastillalamancha.es">La Mancha</a>. However, at the age of three, I was moved to <a href="https://turismodecantabria.com/inicio">Cantabria</a>, one of the most enchanting regions in the North of Spain. I am very proud of my multicultural Spanish roots, which provide me with a wide Spanish vocabulary and culinary skills (and my open-minded thinking, of course).</p>
<p>I belong to one of the first Spanish generations that grew up taking advantage of the European Union's budget in education. I completed my compulsory education in a French bilingual programme carrying out several exchanges in France. I also spent some summers in England improving Shakespeare's language. During my late High School years, I took part in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comenius_programme">Comenius Programme</a>, experiencing what being an european student is like in Berlin (Germany). Futhermore, I even studied Dutch thanks to the <a href="http://llp.eupa.org.mt/erasmus-intensive-language-course-eilc/">Erasmus Intensive Language Courses (EILC)</a> (already dissapeared) and I have recently travelled around Europe using the <a href="https://www.interrail.eu">Interrail Pass</a> that is partially financiated for European young people. With this background, I naturally feel European and I am a strong supporter of the European Union, the one that has always evolved thanks to social policies and the reinforce of human rights.</p>
<p>Finally, when I am not stuying/working, I enjoy developping my artistic side: playing the piano and singing (I have graduated in Professional Teachings in Music at <a href="http://www.conservatoriojesusdemonasterio.es">Conservatorio Jesús de Monasterio</a>), painting (mostly landscapes), gardering and cooking. Finally, I do love learning, reading, writing and speaking in all languages I can (currently, in this order, English, Spanish, Dutch, French and little German), and getting to know different cultures to continue enriching myself.</p>
