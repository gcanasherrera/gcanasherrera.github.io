I’m thrilled to share that I have been awarded a **Veni grant** from the Dutch Research Council (*Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek*, NWO). This prestigious funding is part of the **NWO Talent Programme**, which supports early-career researchers to pursue their own innovative research ideas and develop as independent scientists. The Veni grant reflects recognition of scientific creativity, originality, and potential to make a substantial research impact.

My funded project is titled **["Unlocking the uNIverse: COsmological infeRence with Next generation galaxy surveys (UNICORN)"](https://www.nwo.nl/en/projects/zcpqi32997)**, where I will explore fundamental questions in cosmology and refine new methods of cosmological inference that advance our understanding of the Universe's largest scales and underlying physics.

This grant provides essential support — both intellectual and financial — allowing me to build on my previous work and establish an independent line of research over the coming years. I’m deeply grateful to NWO for this opportunity and to my collaborators and mentors who have supported me along the way. I look forward to sharing updates on the project as it progresses! 🚀
